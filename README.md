# 3dplotter_time_and_xy
This plotter platform demonstrate any mathematical expression with parameters x,c(color) and t(time) in the given interval:
![Alt text](/Demo/GUI_plot_output_page(4).png "Optional Title")
1)Firstly you should write a valid mathematical expression including any function in calc/expressions classes(including ~35 functions) like "mul(add(sin(x,t)),c)".
2)Next, you should determine the intervals of the mentioned parameter that you want to see in the screen, and also the accuracy of expression calculations.
3)You can see your plot moving on the time interval you have entered in the different c-values(colors) you've chosen. 
PS: You can zoom on an specefic interval interactivly, study the plot values by moving the cursor, save and load current plot configuration.
